Database: A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a computer system. It is designed to allow for efficient retrieval, storage, and manipulation of data.

Table: In a relational database, data is organized into tables. A table consists of rows and columns where each column represents a specific attribute of the data, and each row represents a record or instance of the data.

Record: A record, also known as a row or tuple, is a single instance of data stored within a table in a database. Each record contains values corresponding to the columns defined in the table.

Field: A field, also known as a column or attribute, represents a single piece of data within a record. It defines the type of data that can be stored and the format in which it is stored.

Primary Key: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record within a table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and provides a way to establish relationships between tables in a database.

SQL: SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and defining database schema.

Query: A query is a request for information from a database using SQL or another database query language. Queries can retrieve specific data based on specified criteria, perform calculations, and aggregate results.

Index: An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It is created on one or more columns of a table and allows the database management system to quickly locate rows based on the indexed columns.

Normalization: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them to minimize data duplication and improve data integrity.

Database Management System (DBMS): A database management system is software that provides an interface for users to interact with a database. It enables users to store, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently while ensuring data integrity, security, and concurrency control. Examples of DBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite.
